Intro Fellowship Application Coding Challenge 

Fall 2024 challenge: Matrix Multiplication!

Write some code in your favorite programming language (Python preferred) that
first reads a value N from standard in, then reads 2 N x N matrices also from
standard input, multiplies them together, and writing the resulting matrix to
standard output. Please use the test harness ensures that your code correctly
interacts with standard out. Additionally, please avoid using built-in matrix
multiplication functions or third-party libraries. Although languages such as
Julia and MATLAB, or Python's numpy library, can already perform these tasks,
avoid using these: instead write the matrix multiplication function yourself.
To be clear, your main concern is that your code is correct. Bonus points for
making your code efficient (ie. cache-friendliness). Good luck, and have fun!

A sample input would be:

3
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

For which the output should be:

0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

Run the test harness with `python test.py YOURPROGRAMHERE`.
